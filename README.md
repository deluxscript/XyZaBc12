    ```
2. **Install project dependencies**

   To start the app, use the command below:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Running Tests

I have included a few tests to show my knowledge of writing tests cases. To run the tests, execute:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Technical Decisions

### 1. React Environment

I opted to use Vite as it offers speed and flexibility.

### 2. UI Toolkit

I opted to use Tailwind CSS as its a requirement for this role and to also display my knowledge about it.

### 3. Testing Strategy

For testing purposes, I chose to utilize Vitest and Jest.

### 4. Custom Hooks

To enhance code organization and reusability, I created custom hooks for the app in terms of initially loading the initial static posts I created and handling of comment functionalities. This approach ensures a clean codebase, promoting maintainability and readability.
